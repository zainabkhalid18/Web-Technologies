                From Our Delhi Correspondent
              </h3>
              <p style="margin: 0 0 7px 0;">
                <strong>DELHI, Oct. 13</strong> &mdash; Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru has issued directives to provincial governments across India authorising the arrest and detention of prominent Muslim political figures. The order, reportedly aimed at curbing organisations believed to be in contact with Pakistani officials, has caused deep alarm among the Muslim minority remaining in India after Partition.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0 0 7px 0;">
                Senior Muslim League representatives still residing in Indian territories are said to be among those targeted in the first wave of detentions. Eyewitness accounts describe sudden overnight raids on the homes of Muslim leaders in Delhi, Lucknow, and Hyderabad, with several individuals taken into custody without formal charges or due legal process.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0 0 7px 0;">
                The Pakistan Foreign Office has summoned the Indian High Commissioner in Karachi to register a formal protest, describing the crackdown as a politically motivated persecution of Muslim citizens and a grave violation of their fundamental rights.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0;">
                Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, speaking at a press conference outside the Constituent Assembly, declared that Pakistan would raise the matter before every available international forum and would not tolerate the silencing of Muslim voices in India.

                <strong>KARACHI, Oct. 13</strong> &mdash; Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah, speaking from Government House in Karachi, urged the people of Pakistan to remain steadfast, united, and disciplined in the face of the extraordinary challenges confronting the young nation. He reminded citizens that Pakistan was achieved through great sacrifice and that internal unity remained the foremost duty of every patriot.

                The Quaid warned that those who wished to see Pakistan fail hoped the new state would buckle under the pressure of the refugee crisis and communal disorder. He appealed to government officials at all levels to serve the displaced millions arriving from India with honesty, speed, and compassion.

                <strong>KARACHI, Oct. 13</strong> &mdash; Municipal authorities in Karachi have issued an urgent appeal for additional medical supplies and food rations as refugee camps on the city's outskirts have been overwhelmed, hosting over four times their intended capacity. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim migrants, arriving daily from various parts of India, have placed an enormous strain on the city's water, food, and sanitation systems.

              <p style="margin: 0;">
                Volunteer relief organisations, including the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, are working continuously to provide shelter and essential care. Government officials have assured citizens that emergency supplies are being transported from Lahore and Rawalpindi to meet the mounting need.

                Kashmir: Conflict Spreads in Poonch District
              </h3>
              <p style="margin: 0 0 7px 0;">
                <strong>RAWALPINDI, Oct. 13</strong> &mdash; Armed clashes in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir are intensifying as Muslim residents continue their uprising against the rule of Maharaja Hari Singh. Thousands of Muslims in the region, many of them veterans of the British Indian Army, have risen in revolt and are demanding the accession of the Muslim-majority state to Pakistan.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0 0 7px 0;">
                Reports from tribal volunteers who have crossed into the region indicate that the Maharaja's forces have been unable to contain the resistance across several districts. Communities in the Mirpur and Muzaffarabad areas are reportedly in open rebellion, and the supply lines of state forces have been disrupted in many locations.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0;">
                Pakistan's government maintains that the people of Kashmir possess the right to decide their own future, and that the state's overwhelming Muslim majority makes accession to Pakistan both logical and just. Liaquat Ali Khan has stated that the matter will be taken to the United Nations if India continues to block a free and impartial plebiscite.

                Maharaja Hari Singh has continued to delay any formal announcement on the accession of Jammu and Kashmir despite mounting internal unrest and a rapidly worsening security situation. Political observers suggest he hopes to preserve independence, a position viewed as untenable given the ground realities.

                <strong>LAHORE, Oct. 13</strong> &mdash; Large convoys of Muslim refugees travelling from East Punjab into West Punjab are continuing to face attacks by armed groups despite the deployment of military escorts along principal routes. Officials in Lahore report that tens of thousands of refugees are arriving in the city each day, many in a state of severe physical exhaustion and trauma after witnessing violence during their migration.

              <p style="margin: 0 0 7px 0;">
                Pakistan Army units have been positioned along the Grand Trunk Road to protect civilian movement. Temporary shelters have been erected at railway stations and open grounds across Lahore, but the scale of the humanitarian emergency has overwhelmed available facilities. International relief agencies have begun initial operations in the city.
              </p>
              <p style="margin: 0;">
                Local relief committees have collected substantial donations of food, clothing, and medicine from Lahore's residents. Appeals for international humanitarian assistance continue to be broadcast over Radio Pakistan, with the government urging foreign governments and Muslim nations to contribute to relief efforts.
